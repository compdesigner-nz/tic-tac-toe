# tic-tac-toe
A game of tic-tac-toe

## Overview
Tic-tac-toe is a very simple game. It requires two players and lets each player choose positions within a 3x3 grid to play their pieces. The aim of the game is to create a line of 3, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each player takes turns to play a marker (either a 'X' or a 'O') and when a player has created a line of 3 X's or O's, they win. The players can choose how many games to play to (usually taking the form of either 'first to' or 'best of').
